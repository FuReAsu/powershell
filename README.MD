Powershell scripts for different usecases made by me for me.

watch       -> similar to linux's watch command. Prints out commands every specified interval.
ani-cli     -> just a powershell wrapper for ani-cli
history     -> a comprehensive powershell history keeping utility. Automatically rotates the history to numbered files if the log count reaches 1000.
vmrun       -> enhanced vmrun command to be able to use names rather than vmx paths. 
ssh-session -> saves and deletes ssh-session. When sessions are saved, local machine's public key is written in remote machine's "authorized_keys" file. A variable is created which is stored in a vars file and which is loaded for current powershell session. When sessions are deleted, both the public key on the remote server and the variable is deleted.
